### [zast.ai â€“ AI Vulnerability Researcher](http://zast.ai)

**Zero-day detection with zero false positives, with zero verification needed.**

**The Need**: Globally [27.7 million programmers](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+programmers+are+there+in+the+world) create 2.7-4 billion lines of code daily.[^1] Even at an extremely conservative vulnerability rate[^2], 30k+ new vulnerabilities emerge every day. That's more than [the 29k CVEs](https://cve.mitre.org/)  published in the entire year of 2023.

**Why is this not solved**:
1. **False Positives**: Traditional tools [overwhelm teams with false alarms](https://www.google.com/search?q=false+positive+rate+of+legacy+SAST+for+web+app).
2. **Limited Experts**: Skilled researchers are [costly](https://www.google.com/search?q=security+researcher+salary), and verifying vulnerabilities with POCs is time consuming so that very few projects can afford it.

**Our Solution**: [zast.ai](http://zast.ai) scans, analyzes, and verifies vulnerabilities automatically, making secure releases faster and easier.

**Progress**: Currently detects Java-based web vulnerabilities, with expansion to more languages soon. Each vulnerability includes a verified POC.

**Success Story**: Found 29 verified vulnerabilities overnight in a mid-size SaaS Java app. The customer immediately committed to a long-term contract.

**How It Works**:
- **Input**: URL, Java archive, test credentials.
- **Output**: Vulnerability report with details, code flow, and POC results.
